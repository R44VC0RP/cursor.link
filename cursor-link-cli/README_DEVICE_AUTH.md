# Device Authorization Issue

## The Problem

The device authorization flow in better-auth returns an OAuth-style access token, but the API endpoints expect better-auth session cookies. This creates a mismatch:

1. **Device Auth Returns**: `{ access_token: "abc123", expires_in: 3600 }`
2. **API Expects**: Session cookies set by better-auth

## Current Implementation

The CLI tries to save the device auth token and use it as a Bearer token:
```javascript
Authorization: `Bearer ${token.access_token}`
```

But the API uses:
```javascript
const session = await auth.api.getSession({ headers: request.headers })
```

Which looks for session cookies, not Bearer tokens.

## Solutions

### Option 1: Use Session Cookies (Recommended)
The device authorization should create a session that sets cookies. This would require:
- Server-side changes to handle device tokens
- Converting device tokens to sessions

### Option 2: Support Bearer Tokens
Modify API endpoints to accept Bearer tokens:
```javascript
const authHeader = request.headers.get('Authorization');
if (authHeader?.startsWith('Bearer ')) {
  // Validate the bearer token
  const token = authHeader.slice(7);
  // Get session from token
}
```

### Option 3: Simplify CLI (Current Workaround)
For now, the CLI demonstrates the auth flow but doesn't persist sessions. Users would need to authenticate each time.

## The Better-Auth Example

The example from better-auth documentation doesn't actually show how to use the token for API calls - it just demonstrates the flow and exits:

```javascript
if (data?.access_token) {
  console.log("\nâœ… Authorization Successful!");
  console.log("Access token received!");
  
  // Get user session (for display only)
  const { data: session } = await authClient.getSession({
    fetchOptions: {
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${data.access_token}`,
      },
    },
  });
  
  console.log(`Hello, ${session?.user?.name || "User"}!`);
  resolve();
  process.exit(0); // Exits without using the token
}
```

This suggests device authorization might be intended for:
1. One-time authentication demos
2. Systems that can exchange the token for a session
3. APIs that accept Bearer tokens

## Next Steps

1. **Check better-auth docs** for how to properly use device auth tokens with API endpoints
2. **Modify API** to accept Bearer tokens from device auth
3. **Or simplify CLI** to just demonstrate auth without persistence
