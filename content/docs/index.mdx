## Quick start

<Steps>
  <Step>

### Create a rule

Go to the home page and start writing a rule. Use the title input (e.g. `index.mdc`) and write your content in the editor.

  </Step>
  <Step>

### Sign in to save

Sign in with a magic link to save. You can also return to your pending edit after login.

  </Step>
  <Step>

### Share or keep private

Save privately by default. When ready, make it public to get a shareable URL and copy a one‑line install command.

  </Step>
  <Step>

### Discover in Feed

Browse the Feed to see popular and new public rules. Copy, download, or add rules to your lists.

  </Step>
  <Step>

### Manage in Dashboard

View, edit, delete, and make rules public from your Dashboard. You can also copy view links and install commands.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## How it works

- **Rule types**: Choose how the rule applies (Always Apply, Apply Manually, Specific Files, etc.).
- **Private vs Public**: Rules are private by default. Public rules get a shareable URL and show up in the Feed.
- **Install command**: For public rules, use the copy button to get an install command (via `npx shadcn add …`) that places the `.mdc` in `~/.cursor/rules/`.
- **Lists**: Add rules to your lists to organize and re‑find them later.
- **CLI docs**: Prefer terminal workflows? See the dedicated [cursor-link CLI](./cli) guide.
